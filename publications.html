												This paper considers the problem of designing distributed Kalman filters (DKFs) when the sensor measurement noise is correlated. To this end, we analyze several existing methods in terms of their Bayesian Cramér-Rao bounds (BCRB), and insights from the analysis motivates a departure from the conventional estimate-sharing frameworks in favor of measurement-sharing. We demonstrate that if the communication bandwidth and computational resources permit, the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator is implementable under measurement-sharing protocols. Furthermore, such approaches may use less communication bandwidth than standard consensus methods for smaller estimation problems. The developments are verified in several numerical examples, including comparisons against previously reported methods.

												This paper concerns the problem of multipath detection in global navigation satellite system
												(GNSS) positioning. An ML method is trained on synthetic data generated by hardware in the loop (HIL)
												simulations, and we use unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to reduce any discrepancies
												between real and simulated data. For this purpose, an UDA facilitated by a cycle-consistent
												generative adversarial network is proposed. It is shown that the proposed method can
												significantly improve the multipath detection accuracy on experimental data compared to
												baseline approaches (including both heuristic approaches and other ML-methods). It is also shown
												that UDA can enhance GNSS estimation performance in the absence of annotated training
												data, achieving a prediction accuracy in hand-labeled experimental data of as much as 99 %.

												In this paper we develop a method for vehicle positioning based on global navigation satellite
												system (GNSS) and camera information. Both GNSS and camera measurements have noise
												characteristics that vary in time. As a result, the measurements can abruptly change from
												reliable to unreliable from one time step to another. To adapt to the changing noise levels and
												hence improve positioning performance, we combine GNSS information with measurements
												from a forward looking camera, a steering-wheel angle sensor, wheel-speed sensors, and 
												optionally an inertial sensor. We pose the estimation problem in an interacting multiple-model
												(IMM) setting and use Bayes recursion to choose the best combination of the estimators.
												In a simulation study, we compare vehicle models with varying complexity, and on a real
												road segment we show that the proposed method can accurately adjust to changing noise
												conditions.

												We consider the problem of jointly estimating the states of multiple global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers modeled with shared biases. In particular, we explore how to best assign these receivers to disjoint sets, so as to retain computational feasibility in the resulting filters. We propose a genetic algorithm that dynamically assigns agents to clusters subject to constraints on the maximum number of states in the clusters. Several numerical examples illustrate the flexibility of the approach, and the choice of genetic operations in the clustering algorithm is motivated by their effect on the algorithm's expected convergence rate. Numerical experiments with a GNSS-inspired problem demonstrates that the proposed clustering can yield a substantial improvements in the mean-square error compared to a random cluster assignment.

												This work deals with the problem of controlling rigid-body systems through space, focusing on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Several promising UAV control algorithms have been developed over the past decades, enabling truly astounding feats of agility when combined with modern sensing technologies. However, these control algorithms typically come without global stability guarantees when implemented with estimation algorithms. Such control systems work well most of the time, but when introducing the UAVs more widely in society, it becomes paramount to prove that stability is ensured regardless of how the control system is initialized.
                        					<br><br>
												The main motivation of the research lies in providing such (almost) global stability guarantees for an entire UAV control system. We develop algorithms that are implementable in practice and for which (almost) all initial errors result in perfect tracking of a reference trajectory. In doing so, both the tracking and the estimation errors are shown to be bounded in time along (almost) all solutions of the closed-loop system. In other words, if the initialization is sound and the initial errors are small, they will remain small and decrease in time, and even if the initial errors are large, they will not increase with time.

												Novel methods are proposed for the inference of radiation intensity
												functions defined over known surfaces, intended for use in surveying
												applications with mobile spectrometers. Previous approaches, based on the maximum likelihood
												expectation maximization (ML-EM) framework with Poisson
												likelihoods, are extended to better handle spatially continuous
												intensity statistics using ideas from Gaussian filtering. The
												resulting algorithm is evaluated against a classical ML-EM
												method, and a recently proposed sparse additive point source
												localization (APSL) algorithm in a Monte-Carlo simulation
												study. The new generalized ASPL (GASPL) is shown to
												compare favorably in terms of estimation accuracy when the
												true intensity is not well described by a set of point sources.
												Finally, the GASPL is used in an experiment where a detector is
												mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle to estimate the intensity
												and location of radioactive sources placed in a meadow.

												Insights from the linear setting illustrate pitfalls in designing optimal recursive

												estimation based on statistical linearization, entertaining two estimate densities and taking

												Prior results on target localization and circumnavigation with bearing measurements in \mathbb R 2 are extended with integral action, resulting in a control system that is robust to bounded load disturbances on the control inputs. Such disturbances may arise in practice due to modeling errors and need to be considered to ensure small tracking errors. The control inputs are modeled as the system velocities in the bearing and orthogonal bearing directions, facilitating an implementation on both aerial and ground vehicles. This is demonstrated in a simulation example, followed by an experimental application with ground-based vehicle circumnavigation, highlighting the performance and importance of using the proposed controllers.

												This paper concerns the robustness of attitude controllers for dynamics configured on the SO(3) manifold and poses a set of bilinear matrix inequalities to find an optimal controller tuning with respect to (i) the ultimate bound of the error-state trajectories when perturbed by naturally arising disturbances, and (ii) the worst-case decay rate of the tracking errors. The presented optimization problem can be solved both to generate a robust tuning for experimental applications, and also to facilitate qualitative comparisons of different attitude controllers present in the literature. To solve the tuning problem, we propose an algorithm based on alternating semidefinite programming, with local linearizations of an upper bound of the associated cost function.

											This work concerns trajectory tracking control of attitude dynamics configured on SU(2). Inspired by a popular geometric tracking controller on SO(3), differential geometric tools are used to derive both continuous and discontinuous attitude controllers on the SU(2) manifold, relating these to preexisting controllers operating with imaginary quaternion errors. Additionally, a robustness result is given for the controllers on SU(2), which is illustrated by simulation
										  examples. One of the major contributions of this work is to highlight precisely how various controllers in the literature are related. This last point is elaborated in more detail in Chapter 3 of my Ph.D. thesis.

The implications for the filtering problem are illustrated by several numerical examples.

											  We present a framework for measurement dimension reduction in Gaussian filtering, defined in terms of a linear operator acting on the measurement vector. This operator is optimized to minimize the Cramér-Rao bound of the estimate's mean squared error (MSE), yielding a measurement subspace from which elements minimally worsen the filter MSE performance, as compared to filtering with the original measurements. This is demonstrated with Kalman filtering in a linear Gaussian setting and various non-linear Gaussian filters with an on-line adaption of the operator. The proposed method improves computational time in exchange for a quantifiable and sometimes negligibly worsened MSE of the estimate.

											  Accurate carrier-phase integer ambiguity resolution is fundamental for high precision global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). In this paper we extend a recently proposed mixture Kalman filter solution to integer ambiguity resolution. We utilize the Fisher information matrix to project the acquired measurements into a lower-dimensional subspace, formulating an optimization program to find the projected measurement that minimally degrades filter performance with respect to the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimate. Using the projected measurements, our method achieves a significant computational speedup while retaining the performance of the original filter. Theoretical results are presented regarding the optimal projection computation, and the claims are subsequently illustrated by simulation examples in a Monte Carlo study.

												Controlled invariant set and viability regulation of
												dynamical control systems have played important roles in many
												control and coordination applications. In this paper we develop
												a temporal viability regulation theory for general dynamical
												control systems, and in particular for control affine systems.
												The time-varying viable set is parameterized by time-varying
												constraint functions, with the aim to regulate a dynamical
												control system to be invariant in the time-varying viable set
												so that temporal state-dependent constraints are enforced. We
												consider both time-varying equality and inequality constraints
												in defining a temporal viable set. We also present sufficient
												conditions for the existence of feasible control input for the
												control affine systems. The developed temporal viability regulation
												theory is applied to mobile vehicle coordination.

												We consider the problem of feasible coordination
												control for multiple homogeneous or heterogeneous mobile
												vehicles subject to various constraints and develop a general framework
												involving differential-algebraic equations and viability theory
												to describe and determine coordination feasibility for a coor-
												dinated motion control under heterogeneous vehicle dynamics
												and different types of coordination constraints. If a solution
												exists for the derived differential-algebraic equations and/or
												inequalities, a heuristic algorithm is proposed for generating
												feasible trajectories for each individual vehicle. In case studies
												on coordinating two vehicles, we derive analytical solutions to
												motion generation for two-vehicle groups consisting of car-like
												vehicles, unicycle vehicles, or vehicles with constant speeds.

												Rotational singularities inherent to three different geometric controllers on SE (3) are studied. A new singularity-free method of incrementally generating a reference rotation is proposed, removing a class of singularities without affecting proven stability properties of the closed-loop systems. If satisfying a bound on attitude rate and maximum loop rate in the reference generation, the proposed synthesis of a controlled rotation enables complex manoeuvres on the entirety of SE(3), demonstrated with high-velocity loops on a toroid surface.

												This paper evaluates the utility of the feedback particle filter (FPF) for state estimation of SE(2)-configured dynamics in a real-time context. The filter is implemented in discrete time to fuse gyroscopic- and accelerometer measurements with Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and camera measurements. With this state information, the FPF is compared to other common filters in terms of the estimate mean square error (MSE) and robustness to initial conditions. An analysis is done on how these metrics scale with utilization of computational resources, concluding that the FPF should be considered for embedded applications with CPUs on par with the Cortex M4 processor.

												The notion of warping the rate of time is explored in the context of differentially flat systems to enable time-optimal motion by convex optimisation. Examples are given with systems configured on the special Euclidean groups SE(2) and SE(3), with and without differential constraints. The proposed method complements classical methods of motion planning, may be used in a real-time context with guarantees on time-optimality subject to constraints on the first two derivatives on the flat output trajectory and all time-warping derivatives. In addition, an iterative method is presented to find close-to-optimal solutions in the event of non-convex constraints.

												The goal of this work is to explore ways of generating state trajectories for dynamical systems subject to computational constraints, obstacles and priority assignment. The algorithms are developed for a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a modular fashion and include (1) a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP) with respect to priorities and obstacle avoidance, (2) a projective algorithm (PA) for finding the shortest paths around obstacles, (3) a quadratic program for minimum-snap polynomial trajectory generation subject to equality constraints to guarantee avoidance of static obstacles. Combined, the algorithms enable simple and computationally efficient motion planning with support in both R2 and R3 exemplified in a real-time implementation.
